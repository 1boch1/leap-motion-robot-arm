# Robot arm controller

I made this code to control a 3D printed robot arm I built using:

- Arduino
- Nema 17 - stepper motors
- CNC-Shield
- A4988 stepper motor driver
- Leap Motion Controller v1 (first version)

## Libraries

- [leapjs](https://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs)
- [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport)

## Preview

I made a brief YouTube video to show the project:

## How to use

- Install the Leap Motion software (use v2.3.1 you find under "Legacy Downloads" on the Leap Motion offcial website)
- Open the software and check the "Allow Web Apps" checkbox to turn on the WebSocket server that provides tracking data to web applications
- Use leapjs to connect to Leap Motion with JavaScript
- Setup your Arduino with GRBL
- Connect to Arduino using Serial Communication (serialport.js library)
- Now you can send GCODE to Arduino based on the data you receive from the Leap Motion

âš  IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS 10:

There is a bug in the Leap Motion software on Windows 10, here is how I fixed it:
